 ðŸŽµ Wait right here I'll be back in the morning I know that I'm not that important to you But to me girl you're so much more than gorgeous So much more than perfect Right now I know that I'm not really worth it If you give me time I could work on it Give me some time while I work on it Losing your patience and girl I don't blame you The earth's in rotation you wait and flee Look at my face when I fuck on your waist Cause we only have one conversational week That's why your friends always hating on me Fuck them though I did this all by myself Matter of fact I ain't never asked no one for help And that's why I don't pick up my phone in the ring None of my ex's is over loopy Nobody flexing as much as I be That's why she text me and tell me she love me She know that someday I'll be over the sea Making my money and smoking my weed I think it's funny she open up to me Get comfortable with me once I got it coming I love her she love me I know that I'm nothing Like someone in the family want me to be If I find a way would you walk in with me Look at my face while you talking to me Cause we only have one conversational week Can I get one conversational lease Shout out to everyone making my beats You helping me preach This music's the only thing keeping the peace When I fall in a pieces Look at the sky tonight All of those stars have a reason A reason to shine A reason like mine and I fall in a pieces Look at the sky tonight All of those stars have a reason
